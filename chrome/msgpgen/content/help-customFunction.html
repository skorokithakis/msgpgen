<title>Hash password generator - Custom algorithm help</title>
</head>
<body>
The custom function hash algorithm lets you specify your own hash function to use.
It will give the result of the last expression in the textbox.
For example if you put
<pre><code>digest(master+":"+domain,"md5","raw").slice(0,length);</code></pre>
in the textbox, you will get the raw string hash of master:domain truncated to the required length.
<h3>Availible functions</h3>
<h4>digest(str, algorithm, encoding)</h4>
This takes in three parameters: the string to hash, the hash algorithm and the output format.<br/>
The hash algorithm can be any of "md2", "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha384", "sha512".<br/>
The output format can be "hex", "b64", "raw" or any desired character set.<br/>
<ul>
	<li>"hex" will return the hex digest. This is what most tools use for output (e.g. md5sum, sha1sum etc.)</li>
	<li>"b64" will encode the result as a base 64 string. This lets you fit more randomness in the password</li>
	<li>"raw" will just return the raw character data. This lets you fit even more randomness in but it may include control characters</li>
	<li>Any other value will be interpreted as a character set to encode the result with.</li>
</ul>
For example:
<pre><code>digest("Hello there","sha256", "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz").slice(0,10)</code></pre>
will give the sha256 digest of "Hello there" encoded in base 36 truncated to 10 characters (which is "1y8j5vkf10" in case you were wondering)
<h4>HMAC(key, data, algorithm, encoding)</h4>
This function is like <code>digest</code> but with one fundamental difference.
It takes in a key parameter and a data parameter and combines them with HMAC.
<h4>getPref(prefName)</h4>
This function gets any firefox preference and returns its current value.
<h3>Availiable objects</h3>
<h4>master</h4>
This is the value of your master password
<h4>domain</h4>
This is the domain of the website for example if the website is "http://www.example.com/foo/bar.html", domain will be "example.com".
<h4>fullLocation</h4>
This is a location object mapping the page's location.
<h4>length</h4>
This is the desired password length.
