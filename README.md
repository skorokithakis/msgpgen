Hash Password Generator
=======================

This is a Firefox extension that generates passwords using multiple methods. It supports methods such as SuperGenPass,
Magic Password, PwdHash, etc. I've shamelessly stolen it from [Tim Anderson](http://www.timando.net) and am hoping to
fix it up and make it work for my workflow.

Pull requests are welcome.
